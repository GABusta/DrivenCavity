## Solution of Driven cavity problem
This project represents a simulation of a Driven cavity problem, using the Finite Element Method.

The solution proposed considers the non-linearities of the problem, solving the Navier Stokes equations that represents the physics behavior.

The solution can be represented in a graphic with the vectors of the velocity as shown

And if we change the boundary conditions, we can observe the next distribution of velocities
